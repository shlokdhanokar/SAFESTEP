EMPOWERMENT OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS
Project Description
There are nearly 285 million visually impaired people worldwide, many of whom are blind and face numerous challenges in their daily lives. One significant problem they encounter is the inability to detect obstacles in their path, which can lead to serious injuries.

To address this, our team has developed a device that can be attached to various accessories (such as glasses, hats, or walking sticks). This device notifies the user when an object is detected within their path, helping them navigate safely and confidently in their surroundings. It ensures the user knows whether their path is clear, enhancing their independence.

Technology Used
Hardware:
Sensors
Camera
Speaker (for audio alerts)
Software:
Programming Languages: Python, C++
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV (cv2)
Pretrained Machine Learning Model: MobileNet SSD (TensorFlow)
Setup Instructions
Hardware Assembly:
The chip, sensors, and camera must be assembled to work together. The sensors and camera will detect any objects within a 10-meter radius.
Programming:
The chip is pre-programmed using Python and C++ to process data from the sensors and camera, ensuring obstacle detection.
Integration:
The assembled and programmed chip should be connected to the camera and sensors to function seamlessly.
Usage Instructions
Attach the device to any accessory that provides a wide field of view, such as glasses, a hat, or a walking stick.
When the camera detects an object within a 10-meter range, the device will trigger an audio alert to notify the user, allowing them to navigate safely.
Theme Fit
Visually impaired or blind individuals face difficulties in detecting objects around them, leading to accidents. This project aims to mitigate that risk by providing real-time notifications when an obstacle is within a 10-meter radius. This solution empowers them to be more confident and aware of their surroundings, improving their mobility and quality of life.

Future Enhancements
Voice Assistant: A future improvement could include a voice assistant that specifies the location of obstacles (e.g., left, right, front) and provides directions in the user's preferred language.
This enhancement will offer more detailed guidance and further improve the user experience by ensuring clarity on where obstacles are located.

By using this device, visually impaired individuals can navigate the world with greater safety and independence.
