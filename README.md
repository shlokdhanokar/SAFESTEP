# SAFESTEP
There are 285 million visually impaired people, many of whom are blind and face challenges in daily life, especially detecting obstacles. To solve this, our team is developing a device that can be fitted on items like specs, hats, or sticks to notify the person when an object is in their path, helping ensure safety.
